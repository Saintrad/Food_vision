Food image recognition, pivotal in computer-aided dietary assessment, stands as a cornerstone for health monitoring and nutrition management. This project endeavors not only to explore this domain but to surpass the benchmark set by the pioneering work of DeepFood: Deep Learning-Based Food Image Recognition for Computer-Aided Dietary Assessment.

At the heart of this pursuit lies the Food 101 dataset, a comprehensive repository hosting diverse food categories captured through images. Inspired by the achievements of the DeepFood paper, which attained a notable top-1 accuracy of 77.4%.

Central to this endeavor is the utilization of transfer learning, leveraging the powerful pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model. Initially employed for feature extraction, this methodology aims to capture intricate food features effectively. Subsequently, fine-tuning strategies will be applied, tailoring the model's parameters to the nuances of the Food 101 dataset. Ultimately, the main goal of this project is to beat the top-1 accuracy of 77.4% which the paper reasearchers obtained.
